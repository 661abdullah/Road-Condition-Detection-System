# Road Condition Detection System

## Overview
This project is dedicated to the development of an advanced road condition monitoring system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model. The primary aim is to detect potholes and debris on roads, which are critical for maintaining road safety and efficient traffic management. The system utilizes real-time video data to identify and classify various road anomalies.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes live feed from road-facing cameras to detect potholes and debris.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs the YOLOv5 model, known for its speed and accuracy in object detection.
- **Alert System**: Generates alerts for detected obstacles, assisting in quick response and maintenance scheduling.
- **Data Analysis**: Offers insights through data visualization of the frequency and severity of road impairments.
